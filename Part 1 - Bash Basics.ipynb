    "# Bash Part 1 - Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Bash?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bash is a computer program known as a 'shell'.  A **shell** is a program that allows the user (that's you) to access the functionality of the operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are generally two types of shell's.\n",
    "\n",
    "- GUI (Graphical User Interface)\n",
    "- TUI (Text-Based User Interface)\n",
    "\n",
    "You're all probably familiar with a GUI shell - the first way most people learn how to use a computer now.  Clicking folders to open them, launching programs via some sort of icons.  Dragging files to move them.  Etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do all the same things (and much more) with a text-based interface. Bash is a text-based shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use a text-based shell at all?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lots of custom programs you use will require it\n",
    "    - It's a LOT easier to write a command-line tool than to give it a graphical interface\n",
    "\n",
    "#### It allows for greater flexibility\n",
    "    - I can, say, write a short command that moves all files beginning with 2012\\_ to a directory called 'backup'\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reproducible workflows\n",
    "    - You can log and save all the actions for documentation/reproduceability \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Cloud\n",
    "    - If you want to do work on cloud servers, you'll be configuring things mostly in the shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where does Bash come from? Where do you find it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Brief history of Bash:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **1971**:  Ken Thompson writes the first Unix shell (the Thompson shell) while working at Bell Labs\n",
    "- **1977**:  Stephen Bourne writes the Bourne shell for Version 7 of Unix (also while working at Bell Labs)\n",
    "- **1989**:  Brian Fox writes Bash (Bourne-Again SHell) as a free software replacement for the Bourne Shell while working for the Free Software Foundation \n",
    "\n",
    "Bash was created 28 years ago!!  Since then, there have been some newer shells that have gained some popularity (Zsh, Csh, and Fish for example), but Bash still reigns supreme as the default text shell for must Unix distributions as well as OSX"

However, you can still get Bash on Windows and even if you use Windows primarily, Bash is a much more valuable skill to learn that MS-DOS or Powershell.\n",
    "\n",
